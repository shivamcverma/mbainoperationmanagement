            "answer_text": "Yes, giving multiple MBA entrance exams like CAT, CMAT, XAT, and MAT is generally a good idea. Most of the syllabus overlaps, so your preparation works across exams, and it reduces the risk of depending on just one test.Different exams open doors to different colleges. For example, CAT is needed for IIMs, while exams like CMAT, MAT, or NMAT are accepted by many private B-schools. Colleges such as Athena School of Management also consider multiple exams and focus on the overall profile, so having more scores gives you flexibility.Overall, multiple exams simply mean more options and backup choices, which is always helpful."

            "answer_text": "I don't think the quality of MBA education is declining overall, but it's becoming very uneven. A lot more colleges have opened in the last few years, so the quality really depends on the institute you choose.Top and mid-tier B-schools still maintain good faculty, internships and placement support. But some smaller colleges don't update their curriculum or offer enough industry exposure, which makes the experience feel outdated.So it's not that MBA quality is falling everywhere — it's just important to pick a college that focuses on practical learning, internships and industry linkages rather than just classroom teaching."
